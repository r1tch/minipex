# Minipex


## Purpose

Minimalistic replacement for "pex", the Python "package creator". Minipex merely zips the contents of the directory.


## Usage

Just run `minipex`, resulting binary name can be specified or will be figured out from current directory name.


## Caveats

It creates a local temp.zip. That is, if you have a temp.zip, it will be overwritten.
